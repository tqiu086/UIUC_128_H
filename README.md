# UIUC_128_H
Group project of UIUC 128 honors

Currently, we are planning to build a program encrypt and decrypt documents. We might start from txt, is it possible, we would develop it to docx. If time assures, we could work on both symmetric and insymmetric encryption: the first one is one code for one encryption method, and for decrypting it, the second is one code for encrypting, but the code for decrypting should be genetrated in other ways. That's all, thank you for reading!
